# Session Summary - Fitment Feature Deployment
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully deployed the vehicle fitment selector feature to **staging.3wdistributing.com** with:
- ‚úÖ Complete theme deployment via FTP
- ‚úÖ Product data import (2,598 products with fitment data)
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints verified and working
- ‚úÖ Project cleaned up and organized
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation created

---

## üîë Key Technical Discovery

**WP-CLI commands cannot execute via WordPress REST API** - they require CLI environment access.

### The Problem
Initially attempted to create a REST endpoint to trigger WP-CLI import commands remotely, but discovered:
```php
class_exists('WP_CLI') // Returns false in web/REST context
```

### The Solution
Use SSH to access the server directly and run WP-CLI commands in CLI environment:
```bash
ssh -i .codex-ssh/id_ed25519 -p 65002 u659513315@147.79.122.118
cd domains/3wdistributing.com/public_html/staging
wp fitment import --source=wp-content/themes/3w-2025/woocommerce-products-all.json
```

### Why This Matters
- **Blog imports** use WordPress native REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`) which works remotely
- **Custom WP-CLI commands** need SSH/CLI environment to execute
- This is an architectural limitation, not a bug

## üîó API Endpoints Verified

All endpoints returning correct hierarchical data:

```bash
# Years (26 available)
https://staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/years

# Makes for 2024
https://staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/makes?year=2024
Returns: ["BMW"]

# Models for 2024 BMW
https://staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/models?year=2024&make=BMW
Returns: ["M4", "M5"]

# Trims for 2024 BMW M5
https://staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/trims?year=2024&make=BMW&model=M5
Returns: ["G90", "G99"]
```

## üßπ Project Cleanup

### Removed (2.31MB saved)
- `woocommerce-products-all.json` (2.3MB) - Already on server
- `wp-content/themes/3w-2025/scraped-products-sample.json` (6.4KB) - Test sample
- `test-fitment-import.sh` (2.1KB) - Superseded by SSH workflow

### Why Removed?
- Files already uploaded to staging server
- Properly gitignored (`.gitignore` line 38)
- Can regenerate from shop.3wdistributing.com anytime
- Repository size optimization

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow (For Future Reference)

### 1. Build Theme

cd wp-content/themes/3w-2025
npm run build
cd ../../..
```

### 2. Deploy Theme via FTP
```bash
bash scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

### 3. Upload Product Data
```bash
# Automatic in deploy-fitment-staging.sh using lftp
# Or manual: Upload woocommerce-products-all.json to server
```

### 4. SSH Import
```bash
ssh -i .codex-ssh/id_ed25519 -p 65002 u659513315@147.79.122.118
cd domains/3wdistributing.com/public_html/staging
wp fitment import --source=wp-content/themes/3w-2025/woocommerce-products-all.json
```

### 5. Verify API

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **WP-CLI Context Limitation**
   - Custom WP-CLI commands require CLI environment
   - WordPress REST API works for native endpoints only
   - SSH access is most reliable for custom commands

2. **Import Method Differences**
   - Blog posts: Native REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`)
   - Fitment data: Custom WP-CLI command via SSH

3. **File Management**
   - Product data files should be gitignored
   - Upload during deployment, don't commit to git
   - Keep local copies only during active development

4. **Documentation Importance**
   - Comprehensive guides crucial for complex workflows
   - Session summaries help future sessions
   - Cleanup reports track removed files

5. **SSH Deployment**
   - Direct server access most reliable for WP-CLI
   - SSH keys better than passwords
   - Document server paths and credentials

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **User Testing**: Visit staging site and test fitment selector manually
2. **Browser Testing**: Test on multiple browsers and devices
3. **Visual QA**: Check mobile responsiveness and styling

### If Tests Pass
1. **Production Deployment**: Use same SSH method for production
2. **Monitoring**: Watch for any errors or issues
3. **Performance**: Monitor page load times

### If Issues Found
1. **Debug**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **API Testing**: Verify all cascade endpoints working
3. **Fix & Redeploy**: Make fixes and redeploy theme
