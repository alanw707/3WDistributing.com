## Technical Details

### API Credentials (Secured)
- Stored in: `.env.shop` (gitignored)
- Consumer Key: `ck_c8e5...` (masked)
- Consumer Secret: `cs_2078...` (masked)
- Base URL: `https://shop.3wdistributing.com`

### Fetch Script Features
- Automatic pagination (100 products/page)
- Progress tracking with real-time updates
- Configurable limits for testing
- Respectful API usage (100ms delays)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Compatible output format

### Import Command Used
```bash
# Fetch all products
node scripts/fetch-woocommerce-products.js

# Import to fitment system
docker exec -i 3w-wordpress wp --allow-root fitment import \
  --source=woocommerce-products-all.json
```

## Data Quality Analysis

### Products Successfully Parsed (2,598)
Examples of parseable product titles:
- ✅ "Akrapovic 2024+ BMW M5 (G90) Carbon Fiber Rear Trunk Lip"
- ✅ "Brabus 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 (W465) Evolution Line"
- ✅ "Tesla Model 3 Performance Carbon Fiber Spoiler"

### Products Skipped (3,050)
Reasons for skipping:
- Generic accessories without vehicle specificity
- Tools and equipment (non-fitment items)
- Apparel and merchandise
- Products with non-standard title formats
- Generic part numbers without vehicle info

**Note**: This is expected behavior - not all products in an automotive shop have specific vehicle fitment.

## Current System Status

### API Endpoints (Verified Working)
```bash
# Years available
GET /wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/years
→ [2026, 2025, 2024, ..., 2000]

# Makes for 2024
GET /wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/makes?year=2024
→ ["BMW"]

# Models for 2024 BMW
GET /wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/models?year=2024&make=BMW
→ ["M5"]

# Trims for 2024 BMW M5
GET /wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/trims?year=2024&make=BMW&model=M5
→ ["G90", "G99"]
```

### Frontend Selector (Ready)
- ✅ Year dropdown: 26 years available
- ✅ Make dropdown: 4 manufacturers
- ✅ Model dropdown: 6 models
- ✅ Trim dropdown: 14 trim levels
- ✅ Search generation: Working correctly

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.env.shop` - API credentials (gitignored)
- `scripts/fetch-woocommerce-products.js` - Fetch script
- `scripts/README-woocommerce-fetch.md` - Documentation
- `woocommerce-products-all.json` - Complete product dataset
- `claudedocs/fitment-woocommerce-import-summary.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `.gitignore` - Added `.env.shop` and `*products*.json`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Test frontend selector with new data (http://localhost:8080)
2. ✅ Verify search results quality on shop site
3. ⏳ Deploy to staging environment
4. ⏳ Test on staging with production data
5. ⏳ Deploy to production

### Future Improvements
1. **Automated Updates**: Schedule weekly API fetches
2. **Enhanced Parsing**: Improve title parsing patterns for higher success rate
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only fetch/import changed products
4. **Analytics**: Track which vehicles users search for most
5. **Manual Override**: Admin interface to add/correct vehicle fitment data

### Parsing Improvements
To increase the 46% success rate:
- Add more chassis code mappings
- Handle year ranges (e.g., "2020-2023")
- Better trim detection patterns
- Category-based inference (if product is in "G-Wagon" category, infer Make/Model)
