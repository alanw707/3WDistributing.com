# Project Cleanup Report - October 31, 2025

**Cleanup Scope**: Post-deployment cleanup after successful staging deployment
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Files Removed

### 1. woocommerce-products-all.json (2.3MB)
- **Location**: Project root
- **Reason**: No longer needed locally - file is deployed to staging server
- **Server Copy**: Available at `staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-content/themes/3w-2025/woocommerce-products-all.json`
- **Gitignore**: Already excluded (line 38)
- **Recovery**: Can be regenerated via shop.3wdistributing.com scraping if needed

### 2. wp-content/themes/3w-2025/scraped-products-sample.json (6.4KB)
- **Location**: Theme directory
- **Reason**: Test/sample file no longer needed after full import completed
- **Gitignore**: Already excluded (line 37 pattern)
- **Recovery**: Sample data not needed for production

### 3. test-fitment-import.sh (2.1KB)
- **Location**: Project root
- **Reason**: Local testing script superseded by SSH-based deployment workflow
- **Replacement**: Use `ssh` + `wp fitment import` directly on server
- **Note**: Script was for local Docker testing only

## Files Kept (Important)

### Deployment Scripts
- ✅ `scripts/deploy-fitment-staging.sh` - Core deployment automation
- ✅ `scripts/deploy-staging.sh` - Theme deployment via FTP
- ✅ `scripts/README-woocommerce-fetch.md` - Fetch script documentation

### Documentation
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md` - Deployment summary and verification
- ✅ `DEPLOY-STAGING.md` - Deployment guide
- ✅ `PRE-DEPLOY-SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- ✅ All `claudedocs/fitment-*.md` files - Implementation documentation

### Source Code
- ✅ `wp-content/themes/3w-2025/inc/fitment-import.php` - Import logic
- ✅ `wp-content/themes/3w-2025/inc/fitment-api.php` - REST API endpoints
- ✅ `wp-content/themes/3w-2025/src/blocks/fitment-selector/` - Frontend block

### Configuration
- ✅ `.env` - Deployment credentials (gitignored)
- ✅ `.codex-ssh/` - SSH keys for server access (gitignored)
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Properly configured to exclude product data files

## Cleanup Rationale

### Why Remove Product JSON Files?

1. **Already Deployed**: Files uploaded to staging server successfully
2. **Size Optimization**: Removed 2.3MB from local repository
3. **Git History**: Files properly excluded via .gitignore
4. **Regeneration**: Can fetch fresh data from shop.3wdistributing.com anytime
5. **Deployment Pattern**: Upload happens during deployment, not via git

### Why Remove Test Script?

1. **Workflow Evolution**: Moved from local testing to SSH-based deployment
2. **Direct Access**: Can run WP-CLI commands directly on server via SSH
3. **Staging Focus**: Testing now happens on actual staging environment
4. **Documentation**: Better documented in deployment guides

## Repository Health

### File Count Reduction
- **Removed**: 3 files
- **Size Saved**: ~2.31MB
- **Gitignored Items**: Already excluded, no git impact

```

## Background Process Cleanup

Terminated stuck deployment processes from earlier troubleshooting:
- `deploy-fitment-staging.sh` background jobs killed
- These were from FTP password troubleshooting phase
- No longer needed after successful SSH deployment

## Git Status

After cleanup, repository contains only essential files:
- No uncommitted product data files (properly gitignored)
- All source code and documentation preserved
- Deployment scripts ready for production use
- Clean working directory

## Future Data Fetches

When product data update is needed:

1. **Fetch from shop site**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/scrape-shop-complete.js
   ```

2. **Upload to server** (automatic during deployment):
   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy-fitment-staging.sh
   ```

3. **Run import via SSH**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i .codex-ssh/id_ed25519 -p 65002 u659513315@147.79.122.118
   cd domains/3wdistributing.com/public_html/staging
   wp fitment import --source=wp-content/themes/3w-2025/woocommerce-products-all.json
   ```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All essential deployment files preserved
- [x] Documentation complete and accessible
- [x] Source code untouched
- [x] Product data available on staging server
- [x] Background processes terminated
- [x] .gitignore properly configured
- [x] Repository size optimized
- [x] Deployment workflow documented

## Summary

✅ **Cleanup Complete**
- Removed 3 unnecessary files (~2.31MB)
- Preserved all essential deployment and source files
- Maintained proper .gitignore configuration
- Repository ready for production deployment

**Next Steps**: Ready to test staging site and proceed with production deployment when approved.
