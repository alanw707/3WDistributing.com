## API Endpoints Verified ✅

All fitment API endpoints are working correctly:

https://staging.3wdistributing.com/wp-json/threew/v1/fitment/years
Returns: [2026, 2025, 2024, ..., 2000]

```

## SSH Configuration

SSH access configured for direct server management:

```bash
# Connection details (stored in .env)
STAGE_SSH_HOST=147.79.122.118
STAGE_SSH_PORT=65002
STAGE_SSH_USER=u659513315
STAGE_SSH_KEY=.codex-ssh/id_ed25519

# SSH command
ssh -i .codex-ssh/id_ed25519 -p 65002 u659513315@147.79.122.118

# Staging WordPress path
cd domains/3wdistributing.com/public_html/staging
```

## Import Method

**Key Discovery**: WP-CLI commands cannot execute via REST API in web context (require CLI environment). Solution was to use SSH to run WP-CLI directly on server.

```bash
# Import command used
wp fitment import \
  --source=wp-content/themes/3w-2025/woocommerce-products-all.json
```

This differs from blog post import which uses WordPress's native REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`) via curl with Basic Auth.
