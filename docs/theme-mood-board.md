## Palette Direction

| Role | Hex | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Blue | `#1D6BCD` | Based on existing 3W header; vibrant enough for buttons and highlights.
| Deep Navy | `#0C1E33` | Anchor color for header/nav backgrounds and footer blocks.
| Asphalt Gray | `#151515` | Performance-oriented neutral for hero overlays and typography.
| Steel Gray | `#2F3640` | Secondary background for cards and striping.
| Accent Red | `#D84432` | Limited-use accent inspired by automotive brake calipers; ideal for warnings/CTA chips.
| Electric Cyan | `#18B8D7` | Optional secondary accent for hover states and active filters.
| Light Smoke | `#F3F6FA` | Soft backdrop for content sections and blog cards.

## Imagery & Texture
- Hero imagery: close-up shots of performance vehicles, carbon fiber textures, wind tunnel lighting.
- Category tiles: 3/4 angle shots with subtle motion blur overlays.
- Blog and editorial: use monochrome photography with blue gradient overlays for cohesion.

## Typography Pairings
- **Headlines:** "Rajdhani" or "Agency FB" style condensed sans for motorsport feel; fallback to "Rajdhani", sans-serif.
- **Body copy:** "Inter" or "Source Sans Pro" for readability across long-form blog posts.
- **Numerics/Specs:** Consider "Orbitron" or tabular variant in fitment selectors for digital instrumentation vibe.

## Interaction Cues
- Bold pill-shaped filters with iconography to match Vivid Racing's fitment UX.
- Animated gradients on hover for category cards (blue → cyan) to signal interactivity.
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations on spec highlights and testimonials.

## Social Proof & Trust Elements
- Horizontal bar beneath hero containing shipping speed, fitment guarantee, and support hotline (mirrors Maxton trust lane).
- Include brand carousel featuring logos of performance partners.
