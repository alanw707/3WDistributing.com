# Blog Import Backlog

- **Verify API Access**
  - [ ] Confirm REST API endpoints accessible on production and staging.
  - [ ] Ensure application passwords are enabled on both environments.

- **Credentials & Security**

  - [ ] Create/write application password on staging (posts/media/taxonomies).
  - [ ] Store credentials securely in `.env` and secret manager.

- **Data Inventory**
  - [ ] Export list of post types, counts, statuses from production.
  - [ ] Inventory categories/tags with slug mappings.
  - [ ] Audit required post meta (ACF fields, SEO meta, canonical URLs).
  - [ ] Identify media usage (featured images, galleries, embeds).

- **Tooling Decision**
  - [ ] Select import tooling (Python script, WP-CLI REST, or Node client).
