# 3W Theme Ideation & Environment Checklist

## Inspiration & Brand Direction
- [x] Compile mood board with highlights from Vivid Racing, Maxton Design, and existing 3W Distributing palette
- [x] Extract shared UX patterns (vehicle fitment search, modular product grids, trust bars) from references
- [x] Define primary/secondary color usage aligned to current 3W blues + darker performance accents
- [x] Select typography pairings (headline + body) suitable for performance aftermarket tone

## UX & Content Planning
- [x] Outline homepage modules (hero fitment selector, featured categories, brands carousel, blog highlights)
- [x] Draft blog/article layout concepts that mirror shop aesthetics
- [x] Map navigation IA covering Shop, Brands, Solutions, Blog, Support flows
- [x] List dynamic data needs (fitment filters, brand metadata, featured collections)

## Theme Foundation
- [x] Document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for `theme.json`
- [x] Sketch wireframes for key templates (Home, Shop, Product, Brand, Blog Index/Post)
- [x] Plan reusable block patterns (hero, product grid, spec table, CTA band, blog cards)
- [x] Identify required custom blocks or React components (fitment selector, brand slider, testimonial strip)

## Local Environment Setup
- [x] Create Docker Compose stack for WordPress + MySQL + optional Mailpit
- [x] Script WP-CLI bootstrap (core install, WooCommerce, ACF/Block plugins as needed)
- [x] Scaffold custom theme directory (`wp-content/themes/3w-2025`) with build tooling placeholder
- [x] Set up local dev conveniences (live reload, Xdebug toggle, database admin)

## Next Validation Steps
- [x] Present mood board and wireframe concepts for stakeholder feedback
- [x] Iterate on tokens/patterns based on feedback before catalog import
- [x] Prepare task breakdown for block/theme build sprint once direction is approved
